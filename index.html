            <p>Something weird and wonderful might be lurking in a graveyard near you this Hallowe’en… No, not goblins, ghouls and ghosts but wildly 
            colourful fungi called waxcaps! Here’s a few to look out for but remember NEVER eat wild mushrooms unless under supervision from a mushroom 
            identification expert.</p>
            <p>Go on the hunt for fabulous fungi! How many different shapes, colours and sizes can you spot?</p>
            <p>Fungi are always around us in nature but mostly hidden from view, underground, waiting.</p>
            <p>Then when the opportunity arrives with cooler temperatures and a spot of rain, they burst from the ground in a bizarre array of shapes and 
            colours, from toadstools to puff-balls! They have some great names too, from the amethyst deceiver to deadman's fingers!</p>
            <p>You should have a real expert on hand before even thinking about eating any. It's best not to touch them. Instead keep your eyes peeled and 
            appreciate them where they are in all their weird and wonderful forms.</p>

                <li>Find your fungi! Fungi grow in lots of places but there is one condition they all need. It needs to be damp. Other hotspots for 
                fungi include rotting tree stumps and damp soil near living trees. In grassy fields look out for big white blobs as that's where the 
                puffballs grow, here you may also see the magical shape of a fairy ring. Remember not just to look at the ground when on your mushroom mission. 
                Many fungi like the jelly ear fungus grow on dead branches. </li>
                <li>ee how many types you can find that match all the ones on our fungi bingo sheet. You'd be super-lucky to see all types, but if you do, 
                make sure you shout bingo! Remember not to touch the fungi you find. As well as being delicate and easily damaged, some are poisonous so 
                stay safe and observe them with your eyes only.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't forget to tell us when you have completed the activity!</strong> When you mark the activity as complete, you will be asked to 
                upload a photo, drawing, painting or a piece of writing talking about your experience to help earn your award.</li>
